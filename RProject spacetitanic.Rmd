This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
spacetitanic <- read.csv('titanic.csv')
spacetitanic
```

```{r}
filter(spacetitanic,Age < 21)
view(filter(spacetitanic, Age < 21))
```

```{r}
filter(spacetitanic, CryoSleep == 'True', Transported == 'True')
view(filter(spacetitanic, CryoSleep == 'True', Transported == 'True'))
```

```{r}
view(arrange(spacetitanic, HomePlanet, CryoSleep,Transported, desc(Age)))
arrange(spacetitanic,Destination)
spacetitanic$Destination
```

```{r}
select(spacetitanic, HomePlanet, Destination, Transported)
```

```{r}
view(summarize(spacetitanic, mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)))
```

```{r}
dest <- group_by(spacetitanic, Transported)
view(summarize(dest, meanAge = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)))
#Age doesn't seem to matter
```

```{r}
dest <- group_by(spacetitanic, Transported)
view(summarize(dest, meanRS = mean(RoomService, na.rm = TRUE)))
#less money spent, less likely to be transported
```

```{r}
dest <- group_by(spacetitanic, Transported)
view(summarize(dest, meanFC = mean(FoodCourt, na.rm = TRUE)))
#slightly less likely to be transported if you spent less at FC
```

```{r}
dest <- group_by(spacetitanic, Transported)
view(summarize(dest, meanSM = mean(ShoppingMall, na.rm = TRUE)))
#not alot of diff for shopping mall money spent
```

```{r}
dest <- group_by(spacetitanic, Transported)
view(summarize(dest, meanSpa = mean(Spa, na.rm = TRUE)))
#less money spent, less likely to be transported
```

```{r}
dest <- group_by(spacetitanic, Transported)
view(summarize(dest, meanVR = mean(VRDeck, na.rm = TRUE)))
#more money spent, less likely to be transported
```

```{r}
spacetitanic %>% count(HomePlanet, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
spacetitanic %>% count(Destination, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = spacetitanic) +

```

```{r}

#Conclusions: 
#You were more likely to be transported if you had CryoSleep
#The mean age was 28.8
#Age does not seem to matter in whether you were transported or not
#The less money spent on room service, the less likely you were to be transported
# You were slightly less likely to be transported if you spent less at the food court
#There was not a lot of difference in whether or not you were transported for shopping mall money spent
#The less money spent at the spa, the less likely you were to be transported
#The more money you spent on the VR deck the less likely you were to be transported
#Most of the traverlers home planet was Earth
#The most common destination was TRAPPIST-1e

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
